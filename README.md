I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building impactful solutions through software development and data science. From an early stage, I traded "usual years of freedom" for late nights debugging, experimenting, and learning. This focus has shaped me into a problem-solver who thrives on optimizing mathematical models, building intelligent agents, and developing AI-driven financial tools. I believe hours invested today lay the foundation for a greater tomorrow, and I'm excited to create technologies that make a difference.<br><br>
